# my-bioinformatics-journal

Hi. I am Hussain Ahmed. A Computer Systems Engineering undergraduate student currently enrolled in my final year at NED University Pakistan 

I have created this repo to document my learning of bioinformatics. I have just started learning it (noob currently) and I am fascinated and I hope to pursue a career in bioinformatics. 
I will be using this repo to upload content regularly in various forms like handwritten notes, algorithm implementations or whatever stuff I find interesting in my
studies. This way I can record my entire journey and hey maybe if someone wonders here by mistake I imagine :( and if they are in a similar position they might find some 
inspiration.

Take care. Loves <3 <3 <3
