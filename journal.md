# my-bioinformatics-journal
Hello future me. I have created this repo to document my learning of bioinformatics. I have just started learning it and I am fascinated. I am currently enrolled in my final year at NED University Pakistan and I hope to pursue a career in bioinformatics. I will be using this repo to upload content in a form of handwritten notes, algorithm implementations or whatever stuff I find interesting on the way.

PS. So silly of me. I forgot to introduce myself properly. I am a computer systems engineering student. I have decided that I will be adding dates to this readme which I will rename to journal. So a lot of the notes I will be making will be biology related since I donot have the background knowledge. Some other notes will conver Rosalind problems. I will try to be more consistent. Hopefully, next post tommorow :)
